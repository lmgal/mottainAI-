# mottainAI

The app mottainAI is an AI app that uses computer vision and machine learning to distinguish whether a piece of trash is either burnable/combustible, non-burnable/incombustible, plastic waste, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste.

### Background
Mottainai is a Japanese word or phrase that loosely translates to “wasteful” or the feeling of having wasted something which might have had certain value. In order to promote efficient and responsible waste management, Japan has adopted a circular economy which aims to minimize waste and maximize utilization of current resources through proper waste management. To aid in this mission, the group proposes an application called mottainAI which uses both machine learning and computer vision to aid in identifying and distributing between different types of waste.
